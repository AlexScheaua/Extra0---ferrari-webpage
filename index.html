              <h3>Scuderia Ferrari</h3>
              <p>Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. is the racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer, Ferrari, and the racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also nicknamed "The Prancing Horse", with reference to their logo. It is the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having competed in every world championship since the 1950 Formula One season.<br><br>The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, races for Grand tourer cars and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia and the Carrera Panamericana.</p>

Rule changes introduced last season led to the introduction of significant aerodynamic modifications and wider tyres, all aimed at increasing performance. Therefore the new 2018 Ferrari F1 car has been created to make the most of the experience gained last year. Compared to 2017’s SF70H, the wheelbase has been changed slightly, with the side dimensions also revised along with the cooling system. The suspension follows the tried and tested practice of using push-rods at the front and pull-rods at the rear, however, their design has been updated based on experience gained during the first season running the wider tyres.

                  <td colspan="3">The number of V6 engines that can be used over the course of the season, without incurring a penalty, continues to decrease, this year from 4 to 3. The same number applies to the turbo-compressor and MGU-H - the energy recovery system attached to the turbo - while only 2 MGU-K -the device that generates kinetic energy linked to the transmission - are allowed over the year, a figure which also applies to the electronic control unit and the batteries. Therefore those in the engine department have also based their work on these new parameters.

In 2006, he finished second in the Formula 3 Euroseries and became test driver for BMW Sauber. In 2007, Vettel began competing in the World Series by Renault and that same year he took over from Scott Speed in the Toro Rosso team, after the European Grand Prix.

                  Kimi-Matias Raikkonen was born in Espoo, Finland on 17 October 1979. He first tried karting at the age of three before going on to enjoy great success in this discipline, as from 1989. He won the Nordic Kart Championship at Varna, in Norway in 1998 and was second in the European Formula Super A Karting Championship in 1999. Switching to single-seaters, he then won the UK Formula Renault Championship in 2000. After taking part in several test with Sauber in Formula 1, Raikkonen signed for the Swiss team for the 2001 season, when he finished in the point four times. In 2002, he joined McLaren, ending the year sixth, while the following year he came second, just two points behind Michael Schumacher. He spent three more years with the British team, before joining Ferrari in 2007 and winning the World Championship that same year. He left the Scuderia at the end of 2009, spending 2010 and 2011 competing in the World Rally Championship and NASCAR. He then returned to Formula 1 with Lotus in 2012, where he spent two seasons. He rejoined the Scuderia in 2014, finishing eleventh in that year’s championship. In 2015 he was fourth and in 2016, he finished sixth.
